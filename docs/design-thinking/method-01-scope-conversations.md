## What This Method Does

Method 1 establishes the boundaries and direction for a Design Thinking project through structured stakeholder conversations. You identify who has a stake in the outcome, what constraints shape the work, and where the scope is frozen (non-negotiable) versus fluid (open for exploration). These conversations surface the assumptions, expectations, and success criteria that anchor every subsequent method.

Without clear scope, teams risk solving the wrong problem, missing critical stakeholders, or building solutions that ignore real-world constraints. Method 1 ensures alignment before investment.

## When to Use

* At the start of any new Design Thinking engagement
* When a project's boundaries, stakeholders, or constraints are unclear
* When sponsors, users, and operators have conflicting definitions of success
* Before committing resources to Design Research (Method 2)

## Space Context

Method 1 is the **entry point to the Problem Space**. The Problem Space spans Methods 1 through 3 and focuses on understanding the problem before generating solutions. In Method 1, you establish what the project should and should not address. Methods 2 and 3 deepen understanding through research and synthesis.

> [!NOTE]
> You must complete scope conversations before moving into research. Skipping Method 1 introduces risk of misaligned expectations and missing constraints throughout the project.

## Key Activities

* Stakeholder discovery: Identify sponsors, end users, operators, and influencers across three tiers: decision makers, direct users, and affected parties.
* Frozen versus fluid assessment: Classify each constraint as frozen (non-negotiable: budgets, regulations, timelines) or fluid (open for redesign: workflows, interfaces, processes).
* Constraint mapping: Document physical constraints (environment, equipment), operational constraints (schedules, staffing), and technical constraints (systems, data, integrations).
* Scope alignment: Facilitate conversations that surface conflicting assumptions and establish shared success criteria among stakeholders.
* Rapport building: Earn trust through active listening, genuine curiosity, and demonstrated respect for domain expertise.

## How to Start

Begin by identifying the stakeholders who own, use, or are affected by the outcome. Then conduct structured conversations to surface constraints and expectations.

Use this prompt to start a scope conversation session:

```text
I'm beginning a Design Thinking project focused on [topic]. Help me identify
stakeholders across three tiers (decision makers, direct users, affected parties)
and classify the known constraints as frozen or fluid.
```

During each conversation:

* Ask open-ended questions that invite detail, not yes-or-no confirmations
* Listen for assumptions stated as facts
* Document constraints immediately with their frozen or fluid classification
* Note areas where stakeholders disagree

## Expected Outputs

* Stakeholder map organized by tier (decision makers, direct users, affected parties)
* Constraint inventory with frozen and fluid classifications
* Scope statement defining what is included and excluded
* Success criteria agreed upon by key stakeholders
* Open questions and assumptions requiring validation in Method 2

## Quality Checks

* All three stakeholder tiers are represented (decision makers, direct users, affected parties)
* Every identified constraint has a frozen or fluid classification
* Scope boundaries are explicit about what is excluded, not just what is included
* Success criteria are measurable and agreed upon by sponsors
* No stakeholder group is assumed to share another group's perspective

## Next Method

When you have a clear scope statement, stakeholder map, and constraint inventory, proceed to [Method 2: Design Research](method-02-design-research.md) to investigate user needs within the boundaries you established.
