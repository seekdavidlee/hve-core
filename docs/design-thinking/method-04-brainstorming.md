## What This Method Does

Method 4 generates a wide range of solution ideas through structured divergent thinking, then converges on the most promising directions through evidence-informed clustering. You move from the Problem Space's validated insights into active solution generation, using constraints as creative fuel rather than limitations.

Effective brainstorming produces quantity and variety first, then applies judgment second. The diverge-then-converge structure prevents premature commitment to the first reasonable idea while ensuring the best ideas survive systematic evaluation.

## When to Use

* After completing Input Synthesis (Method 3) with validated themes and a clear problem statement
* When the team has shared understanding of user needs and is ready to ideate
* When entering the Solution Space for the first time, or returning from Method 8 when testing invalidated a core concept
* When existing solutions feel stale and the team needs fresh perspectives

## Space Context

Method 4 is the **entry point to the Solution Space**. The Solution Space spans Methods 4 through 6 and focuses on generating, articulating, and prototyping solutions. Method 4 produces raw ideas, Method 5 shapes them into coherent concepts, and Method 6 builds lo-fi prototypes to test them.

> [!NOTE]
> Entering the Solution Space requires validated synthesis from the Problem Space. If problem statements are vague or unsupported by evidence, brainstorming produces scattered ideas that don't address real user needs.

## Key Activities

* Divergent ideation: Generate a high volume of ideas without evaluation. Target 15 or more ideas across 4 to 6 categories. Quantity and variety matter more than polish at this stage.
* Constraint-informed generation: Use frozen constraints from Method 1 as creative boundaries that shape ideas rather than block them. Fluid constraints can be challenged or redesigned as part of the solution.
* AI collaboration: Use AI as a brainstorming partner through three patterns: Prep and Synthesis (AI prepares stimulus material and organizes outputs), Backup Generator (AI generates additional ideas when team momentum stalls), and Silent Observer (AI captures and categorizes ideas during team sessions).
* Philosophy-based clustering: Group ideas not by surface similarity but by their underlying approach or philosophy. Ideas that look different but share the same theory of change belong together.
* Convergent evaluation: Assess clusters against the problem statement, validated constraints, and stakeholder needs. Identify 3 to 5 themes that represent distinct solution directions worth developing further.

## How to Start

Review the problem statement and key themes from Method 3. Set up a brainstorming session with clear rules: defer judgment, build on others' ideas, and aim for quantity over quality.

Use this prompt to kick off ideation:

```text
Our problem statement is: [problem statement from Method 3]. The key constraints are
[frozen constraints]. Generate 15+ diverse solution ideas that address this problem,
including unconventional approaches that challenge fluid constraints.
```

During brainstorming:

* Separate idea generation from idea evaluation completely
* Encourage wild ideas: they often contain seeds of practical innovation
* Use constraints as creative prompts, not filters
* Document every idea, even ones that seem impractical

## Expected Outputs

* Idea inventory with 15 or more ideas across 4 to 6 categories
* Philosophy-based clusters grouping ideas by underlying approach
* 3 to 5 converged themes representing distinct solution directions
* Constraint analysis showing which ideas work within frozen constraints and which challenge fluid constraints
* Evaluation notes connecting promising clusters to validated user needs from Method 3

## Quality Checks

* Divergent phase produced sufficient quantity and variety (15+ ideas, 4+ categories)
* Ideas are clustered by underlying philosophy, not surface similarity
* Frozen constraints are respected; fluid constraints are challenged intentionally
* Converged themes trace back to validated problem statements and user needs
* No single stakeholder perspective dominates the idea selection

## Next Method

When you have 3 to 5 converged solution themes grounded in the problem statement and constraint landscape, proceed to [Method 5: User Concepts](method-05-user-concepts.md) to articulate these themes into structured concept descriptions.
