## What This Method Does

Method 5 transforms the converged brainstorming themes from Method 4 into structured concept descriptions that stakeholders can evaluate. Each concept is articulated clearly enough for a 30-second comprehension test and assessed through three lenses: desirability (do users want it?), feasibility (can it be built?), and viability (does it make business sense?).

Concepts bridge the gap between abstract ideas and tangible prototypes. A well-articulated concept communicates its value, constraints, and trade-offs clearly enough for informed decision-making before committing to prototype construction.

## When to Use

* After completing Brainstorming (Method 4) with 3 to 5 converged solution themes
* When ideas need structure, specificity, and stakeholder-ready articulation
* When the team needs to evaluate trade-offs across desirability, feasibility, and viability before prototyping
* Before committing resources to lo-fi prototype construction (Method 6)

## Space Context

Method 5 sits in the **middle of the Solution Space**, between idea generation (Method 4) and prototype construction (Method 6). Where brainstorming produces raw directions, concepts give those directions enough definition to evaluate and compare. The concepts you develop here determine which prototypes get built.

> [!NOTE]
> Concepts should be clear enough for someone outside the project team to understand in 30 seconds. If a concept requires lengthy explanation, it needs further refinement before moving to prototyping.

## Key Activities

* Concept articulation: Develop each brainstorming theme into a structured concept description. Define the core value proposition, target user, key interaction pattern, and primary constraint trade-offs.
* Three-lens evaluation: Assess each concept through desirability (does it address validated user needs from research?), feasibility (can it work within frozen technical and environmental constraints?), and viability (does it align with business objectives and resource realities?).
* 30-second comprehension test: Verify that each concept can be understood by someone unfamiliar with the project in 30 seconds or less. If it takes longer, simplify the articulation or split the concept.
* Silent Review sequence: Have stakeholders review concepts independently before group discussion. This prevents the loudest voice from anchoring the group and surfaces diverse perspectives.
* Concept comparison: Evaluate concepts against each other using the three-lens ratings. Identify which concepts advance to prototyping, which merge with others, and which are set aside with documented rationale.

## How to Start

Take the converged themes from Method 4 and develop each into a structured concept. Focus on clarity and specificity rather than visual presentation.

Use this prompt to develop a concept:

```text
Our brainstorming produced a theme around [theme description]. The target users are
[user group] working in [environment] with these constraints: [key constraints].
Help me articulate this as a structured concept covering: value proposition,
target user, key interaction, and constraint trade-offs.
```

When articulating concepts:

* Lead with the user need the concept addresses, not the technology it uses
* Be specific about trade-offs: what does this concept sacrifice to achieve its primary value?
* Keep descriptions concise enough for the 30-second comprehension test
* Include constraint interactions, especially how the concept handles frozen constraints

## Expected Outputs

* Structured concept descriptions with value propositions, target users, and interaction patterns
* Three-lens evaluation ratings (desirability, feasibility, viability) for each concept
* Comparison matrix ranking concepts across the three lenses
* Stakeholder feedback from Silent Review sessions
* Advancement decisions with rationale for each concept (advance, merge, or set aside)

## Quality Checks

* Each concept passes the 30-second comprehension test
* Three-lens evaluation covers desirability, feasibility, and viability with specific evidence
* Concepts trace back to validated user needs from the Problem Space, not just team preferences
* Silent Review was conducted before group discussion to prevent anchoring bias
* Set-aside decisions include documented rationale, not just preference

## Next Method

When you have evaluated concepts with three-lens ratings and clear advancement decisions, proceed to [Method 6: Lo-Fi Prototypes](method-06-lofi-prototypes.md) to build scrappy, fast prototypes that test your concept assumptions in real environments.
