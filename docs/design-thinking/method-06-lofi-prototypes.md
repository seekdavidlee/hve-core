## What This Method Does

Method 6 builds fast, low-fidelity prototypes that test your concept assumptions in real environments. You create 3 to 5 variations per concept using the cheapest materials and fastest methods available. The goal is constraint discovery and assumption testing, not finished products.

Lo-fi prototypes reveal problems that concept descriptions cannot. Putting something tangible in front of users in their actual environment exposes interaction failures, environmental constraints, and workflow conflicts that no amount of planning anticipates.

## When to Use

* After completing User Concepts (Method 5) with evaluated concepts ready for physical testing
* When assumptions about user interaction, environment, or workflow need validation through tangible artifacts
* When the team needs to fail fast and learn cheaply before investing in hi-fi construction
* Before committing to technical implementation in Method 7

## Space Context

Method 6 is the **exit point of the Solution Space**. It concludes the solution development phase (Methods 4 through 6) and prepares the team for the Validation Space (Methods 7 through 9). The constraint discoveries and user feedback you gather here directly inform the technical prototyping in Method 7.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Solution-to-Validation transition requires demonstrated constraint discovery from real-environment testing. Moving to hi-fi prototyping without lo-fi learning wastes resources on solutions that may not survive contact with reality.

## Key Activities

* Scrappy prototype construction: Build prototypes in minutes to hours, not days or weeks. Use paper, cardboard, sticky notes, simple digital mockups, or whatever communicates the concept fastest. If it takes too long, reduce fidelity.
* Variation generation: Create 3 to 5 variations per concept to test different approaches to the same problem. Variations reveal which aspects of a concept matter most to users and which can change without impact.
* Real-environment testing: Test prototypes in the actual environment where users work. Bring the prototype to the factory floor, the clinic, the office, or the field site. Controlled lab conditions mask the constraints that matter most.
* Feedback planning: Design feedback sessions that capture behavior, not opinions. Watch what users do with the prototype, where they hesitate, what they ignore, and what they modify on the fly.
* Constraint discovery: Document every constraint the prototype reveals: environmental factors that interfere, workflow steps that conflict, user behaviors that contradict assumptions, and physical limitations that block the interaction.

> [!WARNING]
> Resist the urge to make prototypes look polished. A prototype that looks finished signals to users that feedback should be minor. A scrappy prototype invites honest, fundamental reactions.

## How to Start

Select the concepts advancing from Method 5 and identify the key assumptions each concept depends on. Design prototypes that test those assumptions directly.

Use this prompt to plan a lo-fi prototype session:

```text
Our concept [concept name] assumes that users will [key assumption] in [environment].
Help me design a lo-fi prototype that tests this assumption using materials I can
assemble in under an hour. Include 3 variations that test different approaches.
```

When building prototypes:

* Set a build-time limit and stick to it (minutes to hours, not days)
* Embrace imperfection: rough prototypes generate better feedback than polished ones
* Test in the real environment, not a conference room
* Plan feedback questions that reveal behavior, not satisfaction

## Expected Outputs

* 3 to 5 prototype variations per advancing concept
* Environmental observation notes from real-world testing sessions
* Constraint discovery log documenting environmental, workflow, and interaction constraints
* User behavior observations separated from user-stated preferences
* Assumption validation results showing which concept assumptions held up and which failed

## Quality Checks

* Prototypes were built in minutes to hours, not days (scrappy enforcement)
* Multiple variations were tested, not a single "best guess" prototype
* Testing occurred in the real user environment, not a controlled setting
* Feedback captures what users did, not just what they said
* Constraint discoveries are documented with enough detail for Method 7 to act on

## Next Method

When you have constraint discoveries from real-environment testing and clear evidence about which concept assumptions held up, proceed to [Method 7: Hi-Fi Prototypes](method-07-hifi-prototypes.md) to translate those findings into technically feasible implementations.
