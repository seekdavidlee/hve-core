hve-core organizes specialized agents into functional groups. Each group combines agents, prompts, and instruction files into cohesive workflows for specific engineering tasks.

| Group                               | Agents   | Complexity  | Documentation                      |

## RPI Orchestration

The Research, Plan, Implement methodology separates complex tasks into specialized phases. Five agents (task-researcher, task-planner, task-implementor, task-reviewer, and the RPI orchestrator) coordinate through planning files to deliver structured engineering workflows. See the [RPI Documentation](../rpi/) for the full guide.

## GitHub Backlog Management

Automates issue discovery, triage, sprint planning, and execution across GitHub repositories. The backlog manager agent orchestrates five distinct workflows with three-tier autonomy control. See the [Backlog Manager Documentation](github-backlog/) for workflow guides.

## ADO Integration

Bridges Azure DevOps work items with local Copilot workflows. The ADO integration agent handles work item discovery, planning file creation, pull request generation, and build status monitoring.

## Document Builders

Four specialized agents for creating structured documents. Includes builders for Architecture Decision Records, Business Requirements Documents, Product Requirements Documents, and security plans.

## Data Pipeline

Processes and transforms data across formats and systems. Four agents handle data extraction, transformation, validation, and loading workflows.

## DevOps Quality

Two agents focused on code quality and deployment reliability. Covers PR review automation and build pipeline analysis.

## Meta/Engineering

The prompt builder agent creates and validates prompt engineering artifacts. Supports interactive authoring with sandbox testing for prompts, instructions, agents, and skills.

## Infrastructure

Manages cloud infrastructure provisioning and configuration. Handles Bicep and Terraform deployments with validation and drift detection.

## Utility

General-purpose agents for common development tasks such as file organization, content transformation, and small automation helpers.

## Design Thinking

The Design Thinking agents provide AI-assisted coaching through a nine-method, three-space framework for human-centered design.

| Agent               | Purpose                                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dt-coach`          | Coaches teams through all 9 DT methods with session tracking |
| `dt-learning-tutor` | Teaches DT curriculum with exercises and assessments         |
