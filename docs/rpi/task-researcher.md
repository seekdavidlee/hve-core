The Task Researcher custom agent transforms uncertainty into verified knowledge through deep, autonomous research. It investigates your codebase, external documentation, and APIs to create evidence-backed recommendations.

## When to Use Task Researcher

Escalate to Task Researcher when your task involves:

* 🔄 **Multi-file changes** requiring coordination
* 📚 **New patterns or frameworks** you haven't used before
* 🔌 **External API integrations** with authentication or complex workflows
* ❓ **Unclear requirements** needing investigation
* 🏗️ **Architecture decisions** affecting multiple components

## What Task Researcher Does

1. **Investigates** using workspace search, file reads, and external tools
2. **Documents** findings with evidence, sources, and line references
3. **Evaluates** alternatives with benefits and trade-offs
4. **Recommends** ONE approach per technical scenario
5. **Outputs** a comprehensive research document

> [!NOTE]
> **Why the constraint matters:** Task Researcher knows it will never write the code. This single constraint transforms its behavior: it searches for existing patterns instead of inventing new ones, cites specific files as evidence, and questions its own assumptions because it can't hide them in implementation.

## Output Artifact

Task Researcher creates a research document at:

```text
.copilot-tracking/research/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-<topic>-research.md
```

This document includes:

* Scope and success criteria
* Evidence log with sources
* Code examples from the codebase
* External research findings
* Recommended approach with rationale

## How to Use Task Researcher

### Option 1: Use the Prompt Shortcut (Recommended)

Type `/task-research <topic>` in GitHub Copilot Chat where `<topic>` describes what you want to research:

```text
/task-research Azure Blob Storage integration for Python pipelines
```

This automatically switches to Task Researcher and begins the research protocol.

### Option 2: Select the Custom Agent Manually

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Alt+I`)
2. Click the agent picker dropdown at the top
3. Select **Task Researcher**
4. Describe your task

### Step 2: Describe Your Task

Provide context about what you're trying to accomplish. Be specific about:

* The problem you're solving
* Technologies or patterns involved
* Any constraints or requirements

### Step 3: Let It Research

Task Researcher works autonomously for 20-60 minutes. It will:

* Search your codebase for patterns
* Read relevant files and documentation
* Use external tools (Context7, Azure docs, etc.)
* Create the research document

### Step 4: Review the Research

When complete, Task Researcher provides:

* Summary of key findings
* Location of the research document
* Next steps for planning phase

## Example Prompt

```text
I need to add Azure Blob Storage integration to our Python data pipeline.
The pipeline currently writes to local disk in src/pipeline/writers/.
Research:
- Azure SDK for Python blob storage options
- Authentication approaches (managed identity vs connection string)
- Streaming uploads for files > 1GB
- Error handling and retry patterns

Focus on approaches that match our existing patterns in the codebase.
```

## Tips for Better Research

✅ **Do:**

* Provide specific technical context
* Mention existing code patterns to match
* List specific questions to answer
* Include constraints (performance, security, etc.)

❌ **Don't:**

* Ask for implementation (that's Task Implementor's job)
* Skip research for complex tasks
* Provide vague descriptions

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall              | Solution                                         |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Research too broad   | Focus on specific technical questions            |
| Skipping research    | Always research multi-file or unfamiliar changes |
| Not reviewing output | Read the research doc before planning            |

## Next Steps

After Task Researcher completes:

1. **Review** the research document in `.copilot-tracking/research/`
2. **Clear context** using `/clear` or starting a new chat
3. **Proceed to planning** with [Task Planner](task-planner.md)

Pass the research document path to Task Planner so it can create an actionable implementation plan.

> [!TIP]
> Use the **📋 Create Plan** handoff button when available to transition directly to Task Planner with context.
