# Checkpoint

## Inputs

* ${input:mode:save}: (Optional, defaults to save) Operation mode: save, continue, or incremental
* ${input:description}: (Optional) Memory file description for save, or search term for continue
* ${input:chat:true}: (Optional, defaults to true) Include conversation context

## Required Steps

### Step 1: Determine Mode

Identify the operation mode from input:

* Default to save when mode is not specified
* Interpret "continue" in the user prompt as continue mode
* Use incremental mode for mid-session progress saves without completing current work
* Prompt for a search term when continuing without a description or open memory file

### Step 2: Execute Operation

Invoke the memory agent with determined mode:

* For save mode: Proceed to save mode phase of memory agent
  * Use the description input as the memory file name, or generate from conversation context
  * Capture Task Overview, Current State, Important Discoveries, Next Steps, and Context to Preserve

* For incremental mode: Update existing memory file with current progress
  * Update Current State and Important Discoveries sections
  * Preserve Task Overview and adjust Next Steps based on progress

* For continue mode:
  * Use the description input as search term, or check for open memory files
  * Search memory directory when no active memory is found
  * Present matches for selection when multiple files match

Proceed with the determined mode using the memory agent.
