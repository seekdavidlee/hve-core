# Method 6: Low-Fidelity Prototypes - Testing

## Inputs

* ${input:project-slug}: (Required) Kebab-case project identifier for the artifact directory (e.g., `factory-floor-maintenance`).
* ${input:testEnvironment}: (Optional) Real-world environment context for testing (e.g., "factory floor", "clinical setting").

## Requirements

* All DT coaching artifacts are scoped to `.copilot-tracking/dt/{project-slug}/`. Never write DT artifacts directly under `.copilot-tracking/dt/` without a project-slug directory.

Invoke Design Thinking coaching for Method 6c (Feedback Planning) to facilitate hypothesis-driven prototype testing, structured observation capture, and constraint discovery documentation.
