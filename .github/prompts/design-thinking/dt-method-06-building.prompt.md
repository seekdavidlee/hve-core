# Method 6: Low-Fidelity Prototypes - Building

## Inputs

* ${input:project-slug}: (Required) Kebab-case project identifier for the artifact directory (e.g., `factory-floor-maintenance`).
* ${input:prototypeFormats}: (Optional) Selected formats for rapid prototyping (e.g., "paper, cardboard, markdown stubs").

## Requirements

* All DT coaching artifacts are scoped to `.copilot-tracking/dt/{project-slug}/`. Never write DT artifacts directly under `.copilot-tracking/dt/` without a project-slug directory.

Invoke Design Thinking coaching for Method 6b (Prototype Building) to guide scrappy prototype construction with deliberate roughness enforcement and single-assumption focus.
