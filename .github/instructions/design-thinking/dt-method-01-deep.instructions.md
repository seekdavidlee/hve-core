# DT Method 01 Deep: Advanced Scope Conversation Techniques

On-demand deep reference for Method 1. The coach loads this file when a user encounters complex stakeholder ecosystems, organizational politics, multi-department scoping challenges, or manufacturing-specific scope patterns that exceed the method-tier guidance.

## Advanced Stakeholder Mapping

The method-tier file organizes stakeholders into three tiers (primary, secondary, hidden) based on proximity to decisions. The layers below reframe that model around impact scope, capturing how influence radiates outward from direct participants to ecosystem-level actors.

### Multi-Layer Stakeholder Maps

Expand beyond direct stakeholders to capture the full ecosystem:

* Direct stakeholders: people who interact with the problem or solution daily.
* Indirect stakeholders: people affected by outcomes without direct involvement (adjacent teams, downstream consumers).
* Ecosystem actors: external partners, vendors, or integrators whose systems or processes intersect.
* Regulatory bodies: compliance officers, industry regulators, safety inspectors, and union representatives who hold veto power over solutions.

Coaching prompt: "We've identified who works with this directly. Who else is affected by the outcomes, even if they never touch the system?"

### Influence and Interest Analysis

Position each stakeholder along two dimensions to prioritize engagement:

* High influence, high interest: key players who shape decisions and care about outcomes. Engage deeply and early.
* High influence, low interest: stakeholders who can block progress but may not attend voluntarily. Keep satisfied through targeted updates and involve at decision points.
* Low influence, high interest: supporters who provide rich context but lack authority. Keep informed and leverage as validators.
* Low influence, low interest: monitor for changes in position. A stakeholder who moves quadrants during scoping signals shifting organizational dynamics.

Coaching prompt: "For each stakeholder, consider: can they change the direction of this effort, and do they want to?"

### Relationship Network Analysis

Map connections between stakeholders to identify alliances, tensions, and information flow:

* Who influences whom informally (mentorship, trust relationships, lunch-table conversations).
* Where alliances exist that could accelerate adoption or create resistance blocs.
* Which relationships carry tension that might surface as conflicting scope requirements.
* How information flows through the organization compared to the formal reporting structure.

Coaching prompt: "When [Stakeholder A] raises a concern, whose opinion do they seek before deciding?"

### Missing Voice Detection

Systematically check for unrepresented perspectives:

* "Who is affected by this problem but has not been part of any conversation?"
* "Which shifts, locations, or roles have we not heard from?"
* "Who inherits the consequences of decisions made here?"
* "Are there seasonal, temporary, or contract workers whose experience differs?"

Flag missing voices early. Gaps in stakeholder coverage compound through subsequent methods.

## Power Dynamics Navigation

Scope conversations occur within organizational hierarchies and political contexts. The coach helps users navigate these dynamics without taking sides.

### Formal Authority vs Informal Influence

Formal reporting structures rarely capture how decisions actually happen. Probe for informal influence:

* The senior engineer whose technical opinion overrides management direction.
* The long-tenured floor supervisor whose buy-in determines whether new processes succeed.
* The executive assistant who controls access to decision-maker calendars and attention.

Coaching prompt: "Who in this organization can say no without it being official, and who can say yes without it sticking?"

### Recognizing Political Pressure on Scope

Scope is sometimes constrained by politics rather than genuine boundaries:

* A department excludes another team's processes from scope to avoid cross-functional accountability.
* A leader narrows scope to a pet solution to control budget allocation.
* Scope expands artificially to justify headcount or organizational relevance.

When the coach detects these patterns, guide users to surface constraints through neutral questions: "What would change about the scope if we included [excluded area]?" rather than confronting the political motivation directly.

### Permission Conversations Disguised as Scope

Sometimes a "scope conversation" is really a stakeholder seeking permission to explore a problem openly. Signals include:

* Tentative language: "I'm not sure if this is in our area, but..."
* Frequent references to what their leadership would or would not approve.
* Requests to keep certain findings out of documentation.

Coach the user to create psychological safety: validate the concern, explore it in a low-stakes format, and help the stakeholder frame the finding in terms their leadership values.

### Conflicting Stakeholder Priorities

When stakeholders disagree on scope, use perspective bridging rather than mediation:

* Reframe competing priorities as interconnected: "How does [Priority A] affect [Priority B] when both are present?"
* Surface shared frustrations that both stakeholders agree exist.
* Identify shared constraints that both stakeholders acknowledge.
* Note divergent priorities without forcing resolution during scoping.

## Multi-Department Scope Negotiation

Complex organizations present scope challenges that span team and departmental boundaries.

### Cross-Functional Boundary Identification

Map where the problem crosses organizational lines:

* "Where does your team's responsibility for this process end, and who picks it up?"
* "Which handoffs between teams cause the most friction or delay?"
* "Are there processes that multiple teams own different pieces of, with no single owner for the whole?"

Boundaries between departments often contain the richest problem space. Problems that exist in the gaps between teams are frequently the most impactful to solve.

### Shared Dependency Mapping

Identify systems, teams, or processes touched by multiple stakeholders:

* Shared databases, tools, or platforms that multiple departments rely on.
* Common workflows that flow across team boundaries.
* Shared resources (equipment, personnel, budget) that create competition between groups.

Coaching prompt: "If we changed how this works for your team, which other teams would feel the impact?"

### Scope Escalation Patterns

Recognize when scope should expand based on discovered interconnections:

* A problem attributed to one team turns out to originate in an upstream process.
* Multiple stakeholders describe the same symptom from different vantage points.
* Constraint discovery reveals that the proposed scope boundary falls in the middle of a critical workflow.

Escalation is a finding, not a failure. Document why scope expanded and what triggered the change.

### Scope Anchoring Techniques

Prevent scope creep while keeping exploration open:

* Anchor to the original business impact: "How does this relate to the [cost/time/quality] goal we started with?"
* Use parking lots for valid but out-of-scope discoveries: capture them in the assumptions log for future exploration.
* Distinguish between scope expansion (justified by evidence) and scope drift (gradual, unjustified widening).

## Manufacturing-Specific Scope Patterns

Manufacturing environments present recurring stakeholder hierarchies, constraint types, and scope boundary challenges.

### Production Line Stakeholder Hierarchies

Manufacturing stakeholder engagement follows a distinct hierarchy with different communication styles at each level:

* Operators and floor workers focus on practical daily experience, information access, and task completion. Conversations are most productive on the floor during natural work pauses.
* Supervisors bridge operations and management, focused on safety, shift coverage, and process adherence. They hold informal influence disproportionate to their formal authority.
* Engineers and maintenance teams own technical systems and understand failure modes. They provide critical context about why current solutions exist.
* Plant management tracks efficiency metrics, throughput, and cost. They frame problems in ROI terms and control budget decisions.
* Safety and compliance officers hold effective veto power over solutions that affect worker safety or regulatory status.

Engagement sequence matters: start with operators and supervisors to understand ground-level reality before engaging management with findings.

### Regulatory Constraint Scoping

Regulatory bodies function as stakeholders with veto power:

* Compliance requirements are non-negotiable scope boundaries, not preferences to weigh.
* Changes to processes involving safety, environmental controls, or quality certification require regulatory review.
* Some constraints are well-documented; others exist as institutional knowledge held by compliance officers.

Coaching prompt: "Which regulations or certifications could be affected if we change this process?"

### Shift-Based Scope Considerations

Problems in manufacturing environments often manifest differently across shifts:

* Day shifts have more management oversight and support resources.
* Night and weekend shifts operate with reduced staffing and may develop workarounds invisible to day-shift management.
* Handoff between shifts is a frequent source of information loss and scope-relevant problems.

Include representatives from multiple shifts in stakeholder mapping. A solution scoped entirely from day-shift observations may fail during off-hours.

### Supply Chain Scope Boundaries

Manufacturing scope intersects with supplier and customer processes:

* Where does internal scope meet supplier-controlled processes (incoming materials, vendor-managed inventory)?
* Where does internal scope meet customer requirements (quality specifications, delivery commitments)?
* Which scope boundaries are negotiable with external partners, and which are fixed?

Supply chain boundaries define hard limits on what can change internally. Identify them early to avoid scoping solutions that require external cooperation not yet secured.
