# DT Curriculum Module 2: Design Research

Design research bridges stakeholder assumptions and user reality within the Problem Space. Where scope conversations collect secondhand accounts from decision makers, design research generates firsthand evidence from the people who experience the problem daily. This module teaches learners how to observe, interview, and validate in context.

## Key Concepts

*Genuine need discovery* — Uncovering actual problems users face rather than confirming assumed needs. Research questions must be open-ended and curiosity-driven ("Walk me through your process when X happens") rather than leading ("Don't you think a dashboard would help?"). Learners often confuse validating a hypothesis with genuine discovery; validation seeks confirmation while discovery seeks surprise.

*Environmental context understanding* — Physical, technical, and organizational constraints affect every aspect of solution design. A solution that works in a quiet office may fail on an 85-90 dB production floor. Learners tend to research user needs in isolation from the environment where those needs occur, missing critical constraints.

*Universal discovery sequence* — Environmental observation → workflow interviews → constraint validation → unmet need exploration. This progression builds understanding from broad context to specific gaps. Learners often skip observation and jump directly to interviews, losing the ability to notice things users have normalized and stopped mentioning.

*Stakeholder-to-user bridge* — Moving from what stakeholders believe about users (Method 1 output) to what users actually experience. The gap between these perspectives is often significant and always informative. A common misconception is that stakeholder descriptions are close enough to user reality that direct user engagement is optional.

## Techniques

*Contextual inquiry* combines observation and interview at the user's actual work location during real work. The researcher watches, asks questions about observed behaviors, and notes environmental factors. Good output includes both stated needs and unstated workarounds. The pitfall is conducting interviews in conference rooms detached from the actual work environment.

*Environmental observation* involves documenting physical conditions, workflow patterns, and tool usage before asking any questions. Watch for 15-30 minutes without interrupting. Good output is a constraint inventory the user never articulated because they have adapted to limitations. The pitfall is observing too briefly to see natural variation.

*Cross-source validation* compares findings from different research methods and different user groups. Agreement strengthens a finding; disagreement reveals context-dependent factors worth exploring. Good output is a set of validated themes with confidence levels. The pitfall is treating one interview as representative of all users.

## Comprehension Checks

1. A team conducted 10 phone interviews with operators and concluded they need a mobile dashboard. What critical research step did they skip, and what constraints might they have missed?
2. Why does the universal discovery sequence place environmental observation before workflow interviews?
3. A researcher asks "Would a voice-controlled system help you during repairs?" Explain why this is a leading question and rewrite it as a discovery question.
4. When stakeholder descriptions from Method 1 contradict user observations in Method 2, which should take precedence and why?

## Practice Exercises

*Exercise: Observation plan* — Design a 30-minute environmental observation protocol for the manufacturing plant floor during a night shift. Identify what you would document (noise levels, lighting, hand conditions, tool usage, communication patterns) and explain why each observation matters for solution design.

*Exercise: Leading question conversion* — Convert these leading questions into discovery questions: (a) "Wouldn't a touchscreen kiosk help?" (b) "Do you have trouble finding information in manuals?" (c) "Would you prefer voice commands over typing?" For each conversion, explain what the discovery version can reveal that the leading version cannot.

## Learner Level Adaptations

Beginners should focus on the distinction between leading and discovery questions and the importance of environment-based research.

Intermediate learners benefit from comparing contextual inquiry with remote research methods and understanding how environmental constraints discovered here feed into brainstorming constraints in Method 4.

Advanced learners should explore ethical dimensions of research (power dynamics with observed workers, consent in workplace settings) and analyze how research design choices bias the findings.
