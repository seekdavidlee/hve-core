3. **Reference instructions** - They're automatically applied based on file patterns

### Post-Installation Setup

Some chat agents create workflow artifacts in your project directory. See the [installation guide](https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core/blob/main/docs/getting-started/install.md#post-installation-update-your-gitignore) for recommended `.gitignore` configuration and other setup details.

## Usage Examples

### Using Chat Agents

```plaintext
task-planner help me break down this feature into implementable tasks
pr-review review this pull request for security issues
adr-creation create an ADR for our new microservice architecture
```

### Applying Prompts

Prompts are available in the Copilot Chat prompt picker and can be used to generate consistent, high-quality outputs for common tasks.
