## Getting Started

After installing this extension, the chat agents are available in GitHub Copilot Chat:

1. **Use custom agents** by selecting the custom agent from the agent picker drop-down list in Copilot Chat
2. **Apply prompts** through the Copilot Chat interface
3. **Reference instructions** — they are automatically applied based on file patterns

### Post-Installation Setup

Some chat agents create workflow artifacts in your project directory. See the [installation guide](https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core/blob/main/docs/getting-started/install.md#post-installation-update-your-gitignore) for recommended `.gitignore` configuration and other setup details.

## Pre-release Channel
