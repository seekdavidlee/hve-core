HVE Core provides the complete collection of AI chat agents, prompts, instructions, and skills for VS Code with GitHub Copilot. This edition includes every artifact across all domains — development workflows, architecture, Azure DevOps, data science, security, and more.

Use this edition when you want access to everything without choosing a focused collection.

Supporting subagents included:

- **Codebase Researcher** — Searches workspace for code patterns, conventions, and implementations

- **Phase Implementor** — Executes single implementation phases with change tracking
- **Artifact Validator** — Validates implementation work against plans and conventions
