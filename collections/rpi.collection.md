Complete complex tasks through a structured five-phase workflow: Research, Plan, Implement, Review, and Discover. The RPI workflow dispatches specialized agents that collaborate autonomously to deliver well-researched, planned, and validated implementations. This collection also includes Git workflow prompts for commit messages, merge operations, repository setup, and pull request management.

This collection includes agents for:

- **RPI Agent** — Autonomous orchestrator that drives the full five-phase workflow
- **Task Researcher** — Gathers context, discovers patterns, and produces research documents
- **Task Planner** — Creates detailed implementation plans from research findings
- **Task Implementor** — Executes plans with progressive tracking and change records
- **Task Reviewer** — Validates implementations against plans and project conventions
- **PR Review** — Comprehensive pull request review ensuring code quality and convention compliance

Git workflow prompts for:

- **Commit Messages** — Generate conventional commit messages following project standards
- **Merge Operations** — Handle merges, rebases, and conflict resolution workflows
- **Repository Setup** — Initialize repositories with recommended configuration
- **Pull Requests** — Create and manage pull requests with linked context

Supporting subagents included:

- **Codebase Researcher** — Searches workspace for code patterns, conventions, and implementations
- **External Researcher** — Retrieves external documentation, SDK references, and code samples
- **Phase Implementor** — Executes single implementation phases with change tracking
- **Artifact Validator** — Validates implementation work against plans and conventions
- **Prompt Tester** — Tests prompt files by following them literally in a sandbox
- **Prompt Evaluator** — Evaluates prompt execution results against quality criteria
