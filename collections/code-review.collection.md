Analyze branch diffs before opening pull requests to catch functional defects early. This collection provides agents that review changed code for logic errors, edge case gaps, error handling deficiencies, and behavioral bugs.

This collection includes agents and prompts for:

- **Functional Code Review** — Diff-based reviewer that identifies logic errors, concurrency issues, contract violations, and testing gaps with severity-ordered findings and concrete fixes
- **Functional Code Review Prompt** — Quick-launch prompt that delegates to the functional code review agent with base branch input
