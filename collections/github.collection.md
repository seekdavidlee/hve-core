Manage GitHub issue backlogs with agents for discovery, triage, sprint planning, and execution. This collection brings structured backlog management workflows directly into VS Code.

This collection includes agents and prompts for:

- **Issue Discovery** — Find and analyze issues across repositories with duplicate detection
- **Triage** — Automated label suggestion, milestone assignment, and priority assessment
- **Sprint Planning** — Organize issues into sprints with effort estimation
- **Backlog Execution** — Execute planned operations against issue backlogs

Supporting subagents included:

- **Codebase Researcher** — Searches workspace for code patterns, conventions, and implementations
- **External Researcher** — Retrieves external documentation, SDK references, and code samples
- **Phase Implementor** — Executes single implementation phases with change tracking
- **Artifact Validator** — Validates implementation work against plans and conventions
- **Prompt Tester** — Tests prompt files by following them literally in a sandbox
- **Prompt Evaluator** — Evaluates prompt execution results against quality criteria
