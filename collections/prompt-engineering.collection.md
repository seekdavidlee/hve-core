Analyze, build, and refactor AI prompts, agents, and instructions with specialized tooling. This collection is designed for teams authoring and maintaining AI artifact libraries.

This collection includes agents and prompts for:

- **Prompt Analysis** — Evaluate existing prompts for effectiveness and identify improvements
- **Prompt Building** — Create new prompts following authoring standards and quality criteria
- **Prompt Refactoring** — Restructure and improve existing prompts without changing intent

Supporting subagents included:

- **Codebase Researcher** — Searches workspace for code patterns, conventions, and implementations
- **External Researcher** — Retrieves external documentation, SDK references, and code samples
- **Phase Implementor** — Executes single implementation phases with change tracking
- **Artifact Validator** — Validates implementation work against plans and conventions
- **Prompt Tester** — Tests prompt files by following them literally in a sandbox
- **Prompt Evaluator** — Evaluates prompt execution results against quality criteria
