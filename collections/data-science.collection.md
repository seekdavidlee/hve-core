Generate data specifications, Jupyter notebooks, and Streamlit dashboards from natural language descriptions. This collection includes specialized agents for data science workflows in Python.

This collection includes agents for:

- **Data Specification Generation** — Create structured data schemas and specifications from requirements
- **Jupyter Notebook Generation** — Build data analysis notebooks with visualizations and documentation
- **Streamlit Dashboard Generation** — Create interactive dashboards from data sources
- **Dashboard Testing** — Comprehensive test suites for Streamlit applications

Supporting subagents included:

- **Codebase Researcher** — Searches workspace for code patterns, conventions, and implementations
- **External Researcher** — Retrieves external documentation, SDK references, and code samples
- **Phase Implementor** — Executes single implementation phases with change tracking
- **Artifact Validator** — Validates implementation work against plans and conventions
- **Prompt Tester** — Tests prompt files by following them literally in a sandbox
- **Prompt Evaluator** — Evaluates prompt execution results against quality criteria
