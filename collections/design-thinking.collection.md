Coaching identity, quality constraints, and methodology instructions for AI-enhanced design thinking across nine methods. The collection supports the HVE Design Thinking pyramid structure spanning Problem, Solution, and Implementation spaces.

This collection includes instructions for:

- **DT Coaching Identity** — Defines the coach's interaction philosophy (Think, Speak, Empower), progressive hint engine, psychological safety patterns, and hat-switching framework for consistent behavior across all nine methods
- **DT Method Sequencing** — Governs the nine-method sequence across three spaces, space boundary transition protocols with readiness signals, non-linear iteration patterns, method routing logic, and coaching state tracking
- **DT Quality Constraints** — Quality constraints, fidelity rules, and output standards for Design Thinking coaching across all nine methods
- **DT Method 01: Scope Conversations** — Frozen vs fluid assessment, stakeholder discovery, constraint patterns, and conversation navigation for transforming initial customer requests into genuine understanding of business challenges
- **DT Method 02: Design Research** — Interview techniques, research planning, environmental observation, and insight extraction patterns for systematic discovery of end-user needs through direct engagement across three phases: planning, execution, and documentation
- **DT Method 03: Input Synthesis** — Pattern recognition, theme development, synthesis validation, and Problem-to-Solution Space transition readiness for transforming fragmented research data into unified problem understanding
