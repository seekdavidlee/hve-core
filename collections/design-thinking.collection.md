Coaching identity, quality constraints, and methodology instructions for AI-enhanced design thinking across nine methods. The collection supports the HVE Design Thinking pyramid structure spanning Problem, Solution, and Implementation spaces.

This collection includes agents, prompts, and instructions for:

- **DT Start Project** — Initializes a new Design Thinking coaching project with state file creation, frozen/fluid classification, and first Method 1 coaching interaction
- **DT Resume Coaching** — Resumes an existing coaching session from saved state, restoring context from the project's coaching state file
- **DT Coaching Identity** — Defines the coach's interaction philosophy (Think, Speak, Empower), progressive hint engine, psychological safety patterns, and hat-switching framework for consistent behavior across all nine methods
- **DT Coach**: Conversational coaching agent that guides teams through all 9 methods with Think/Speak/Empower philosophy
- **DT Coaching State** — Session persistence schema, method progress tracking, and session recovery protocol enabling the coach to resume seamlessly across conversations
- **DT Method Sequencing** — Governs the nine-method sequence across three spaces, space boundary transition protocols with readiness signals, non-linear iteration patterns, method routing logic, and coaching state tracking
- **DT Quality Constraints** — Quality constraints, fidelity rules, and output standards for Design Thinking coaching across all nine methods
- **DT Method 01: Scope Conversations** — Frozen vs fluid assessment, stakeholder discovery, constraint patterns, and conversation navigation for transforming initial customer requests into genuine understanding of business challenges
- **DT Method 02: Design Research** — Interview techniques, research planning, environmental observation, and insight extraction patterns for systematic discovery of end-user needs through direct engagement across three phases: planning, execution, and documentation
- **DT Method 03: Input Synthesis** — Pattern recognition, theme development, synthesis validation, and Problem-to-Solution Space transition readiness for transforming fragmented research data into unified problem understanding
- **DT Method 03 Deep** — Advanced affinity analysis with multi-pass clustering, insight frameworks with observation-inference-insight formula, HMW question scaffolding, problem statement articulation, and manufacturing synthesis patterns
- **DT→RPI Handoff Contract** — Exit-point definitions, artifact schemas, per-agent input contracts, graduation awareness behavior, and quality markers for lateral transitions from Design Thinking coaching into the RPI workflow
- **DT Method 07: High-Fidelity Prototypes** — Technical translation, functional prototypes, and specifications for Implementation Space entry with three-hat architecture and progressive fidelity modeling
- **DT Method 07: Deep Expertise** — On-demand fidelity translation, architecture trade-off analysis, specification writing patterns, and manufacturing-specific prototyping guidance for complex Method 7 coaching scenarios
